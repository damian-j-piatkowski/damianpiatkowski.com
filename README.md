## Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be set for the Flask project to run correctly:

- `BASE_THUMBNAIL_PATH`: Path where blog post thumbnails will be stored.
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection URL.
- `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for Flask session management.
- `FLASK_ENV`: The environment in which the Flask app is running (e.g., development, production). Determines the configuration to load and can affect debugging and logging.
- `PORTFOLIO_WEBSITE_FLASK_SECRET`: Another secret key, potentially for additional security measures or other secret uses within the application.
- `MAIL_USERNAME`: The username for the email account used to send emails from the application.
- `MAIL_PASSWORD`:application-specific password generated by Google for a Gmail account, specifically configured to allow your application to send emails via Gmail's SMTP server.
- `MAIL_RECIPIENT`: The default recipient email address for notifications or other email communications from the application.
- `DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY`: The directory where downloaded files will be stored.

Ensure that these environment variables are set in your environment before running the application.
